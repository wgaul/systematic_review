Generally, it seems that this FRESCALO method is meant for cases in which individual visits or lists have not been specified, so records are aggregated into block lists, which may include multiple visits.  Therefore, methods using any kind of survey effort estimate that relies on individual lists don't apply.  Overall, I think I'd rather work with methods that explicitly model many biases / problems (occupancy models, GLMs), instead of using Frescalo which seems to just produce a single correction factor that lumps occurence and detection probabilities.  Still, this does seem useful to identify areas with unusually high or low species richness or rare individual species, even as compared to other similar areas (which seems useful).},

May be suitable for detecting temporal population trends in common species, which could be relevant for conservation prioritizaion, red listing, etc.

  abstract  = {Ecological systems are inherently complex. The processes that affect the distributions of animals and plants operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales, presenting a unique challenge for the development and coordination of effective conservation strategies, particularly for wide-ranging species. To study ecological systems across scales, data must be collected at fine resolutions across broad spatial and temporal extents. Crowdsourcing has emerged as an efficient way to gather these data by engaging large numbers of people to record observations. However, data gathered by crowdsourced projects are often biased due to the opportunistic approach of data collection. In this article, the authors have propose a general class of models called AdaSTEM that are designed to meet these challenges by adapting to multiple scales while exploiting variation in data density common with crowdsourced data. This analysis shows how AdaSTEM can automatically adapt to complex spatiotemporal processes across a range of scales, thus providing an essential information for full-life cycle conservation planning of broadly distributed species, communities, and ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {The use of multiple working hypotheses to gain strong inference is widely promoted as a means to enhance the effectiveness of scientific investigation. Only 21 of 100 randomly selected studies from the ecological and evolutionary literature tested more than one hypothesis and only eight tested more than two hypotheses. The surprising rarity of application of multiple working hypotheses suggests that this gap between theory and practice might reflect some fundamental issues. Here, we identify several intellectual and practical barriers that discourage us from using multiple hypotheses in our scientific investigation. While scientists have developed a number of ways to avoid biases, such as the use of double-blind controls, we suspect that few scientists are fully aware of the potential influence of cognitive bias on their decisions and they have not yet adopted many techniques available to overcome intellectual and practical barriers in order to improve scientific investigation.},

For example, the explicitly define "true distribution" as "the distribution estimated by our model", and then spend the whole paper talking about how other models deviate from the true distribution.  Well fucking of coures... when you define "true" as a single model, of course other models will deviate from it.  But they are deviating from a model, not necessarily from the "truth".

Anyway, other than some head-up-but crap like that, this might be useful.

Also, I'm not sure correlation is the best measure here.  

If this is a real, true thing, then it would be useful to know.  But would require testing against true richness, not against observed richness.

Could be plenty to follow up on here, in particular doing something similar in IE where there are fewer possible species and so perhaps errors would be fewer.  

Also, there is a big opportunity to try this study with longer recordings to see if longer survey period can give people more time to correctly identify things.  If so, this would be an important argument in favor of longer survey periods.  },

  abstract  = {In honeybees, employed foragers recruit unemployed hive mates to food sources by dances from which a human observer can read the distance and direction of the food source1. When foragers collect food in a short, narrow tunnel, they dance as if the food source were much farther away. Dancers gauge distance by retinal image flow on the way to their destination. Their visually driven odometer misreads distance because the close tunnel walls increase optic flow2. We examined how hive mates interpret these dances. Here we show that recruited bees search outside in the direction of the tunnel at exaggerated distances and not inside the tunnel where the foragers come from. Thus, dances must convey information about the direction of the food source and the total amount of image motion en route to the food source, but they do not convey information about absolute distances. We also found that perceived distances on various outdoor routes from the same hive could be considerably different. Navigational errors are avoided as recruits and dancers tend to fly in the same direction. Reported racial differences in honeybee dances1 could have arisen merely from differences in the environments in which these bees flew.},

  abstract    = {The simulator is an R package that streamlines the process of performing simulations by creating a common infrastructure that can be easily used and reused across projects. Methodological statisticians routinely write simulations to compare their methods to preexisting ones. While developing ideas, there is a temptation to write "quick and dirty" simulations to try out ideas. This approach of rapid prototyping is useful but can sometimes backfire if bugs are introduced. Using the simulator allows one to remove the "dirty" without sacrificing the "quick." Coding is quick because the statistician focuses exclusively on those aspects of the simulation that are specific to the particular paper being written. Code written with the simulator is succinct, highly readable, and easily shared with others. The modular nature of simulations written with the simulator promotes code reusability, which saves time and facilitates reproducibility. The syntax of the simulator leads to simulation code that is easily human-readable. Other benefits of using the simulator include the ability to "step in" to a simulation and change one aspect without having to rerun the entire simulation from scratch, the straightforward integration of parallel computing into simulations, and the ability to rapidly generate plots, tables, and reports with minimal effort.},
